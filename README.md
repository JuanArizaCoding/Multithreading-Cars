# Multithreading-Cars
This project has cars that come out from the left and right with two buttons. Each car is on a Thread and they arrive at a shared area (a bridge). The cars will never collide with each other, because there is a block implemented for the area shared between the different cars. Concurrency problem seen with a very cool interface.
